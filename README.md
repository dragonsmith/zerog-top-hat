# Zero G Mercury One.1 (Ender 5 Plus) enclosure top hat

This is the top hat for Ender 5 Plus converted to [Zero G Mercury One.1](https://github.com/ZeroGDesign/Mercury/tree/BETA1.0.1) 3D printer.

## Idea

The main idea behind this top hat was to be able to make it at home with as little special instruments as possible, thus there are some downsides of this design (e.g. it currently supports only 2mm top acrylic/PC panel).

- You can buy any 2020 extrusions and cut them with a home-made or a simple 90 degrees angle jig.
- You can cut acrylic panes by a scraper/exacto knife.
- You will need to drill not many holes in the acrylic top panel, not to worry with acrylic cracking druring the drilling process (side panels are mounted by a VHB tape, which also adds more insulation)

My tests show that I'm able to get stable 47-49C in the hat itself in about 25-35 minutes.

This top hat was hugely inspired by [Vez's VzVot](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330) design.

## Build guide

### Print plastic parts

;)

All outside parts can be printed in PLA, but ABS is always more preferrable.

### Cut your extrusions to the length

> **Note**
> You can skip the step if you have your extrusions pre-cut by a supplier

### Tap your extrusion for blind joints

> **Note**
> Watch a great video by [Nero3D about blind joints](https://youtu.be/2dvbn0rWA60) if you aren't familiar with the concept*

> **Warning** 
> Use **5mm** tap if you have ~4mm inside diameter in you particular extrusions, or **6mm** tap if you have ~5mm internal diameter in you extrusions.

You need to tap *10 holes*.

**TODO: IMG here**

### Drill access holes for blind joints

> **Warning** 
> Use **4mm** drill bit to make access holes for M5 blots, or **5mm** drill bit to make access holes for M6 bolts.
